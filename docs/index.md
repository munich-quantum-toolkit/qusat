# MQT QuSAT - A Tool for Utilizing SAT in Quantum Computing

MQT QuSAT is a tool for utilizing satisfiablity testing (SAT) techniques in quantum computing.
It is developed as part of the _{doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>`_.

We recommend you to start with the {doc}`installation instructions <installation>`.
Then proceed to read the quickstart section below.
If you are interested in the theory behind MQT QuSAT, have a look at the publications in the {doc}`publication list <references>`.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions to the project.
If you want to contribute, you can find more information in the {doc}`contribution guide <contributing>`.
If you are having trouble with the installation or the usage of MQT QuSAT, please let us know on our {doc}`support page <support>`.

## Quickstart

The results from {cite:p}`berent2022sat` can be reproduced by first building the project as described below and then executing the resulting `qusat_test` executable in the build directory.
In order to replicate the full range of results, the `test/test_satencoder.cpp` needs to be modified before building the project.
The corresponding lines to be changed are marked with a `// Paper Evaluation:` comment.

Running the executable, produces several `.json` files containing the experimental data. The python script `/results/visualizer.py` can be used
to plot the respective data.

Note that, as we use a randomized procedure to generate input data, the exact experimental data will slightly vary every time the benchmarks are run.
The experimental data used in the {cite:p}`berent2022sat` is available in `/results` directory.
